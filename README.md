# Useful Unity Systems By Enfity

This is a folder with useful systems for Unity, written and frequently used by me.
I admit the possibility of improving the written code and changing my mechanics for your needs.

<br>Assets list:
1. AutoDeviceSimulator - this script automatically creates a XR Device Simulator object on your game scene only in Unity editor mode (for AR/MR/VR games).
2. ControllerVibration - this script allows you to use the controller vibration in the game (this script has been tested on Oculus Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3 VR controllers).
3. Following - with this script, you can make one game object repeat the position and rotation of another game object.
4. ForMenus - useful methods for game menus.
5. FPSCount - a simple FPS counter.
6. LanguageText - This script allows you to create a simple text translation system for other languages in your game.
7. NearestPointOfHit - this is how to track the contact point when one object hits another object.
8. NuclearOptimization - this method disable all mesh renderers, when it called.
9. SimpleShooting - this is the code for a simple physical shooting system for your game.
10. SliderSoundSystem - this system allows you to control the volume of each type of game sounds. Each type of game sound can contain multiple AudioSources.
11. SmoothMovementWithRotation - this script allows you to create a flying game object form one point to another (the original game object also performs a smooth rotation to the target point).
12. StringTimer - converter from integer format to "string time" format (you can use this methods for timers or clocks in your game).
13. TryGetUniqueValue - this method tries to minimize duplication of a random int value from the range [minValue, maxValue).
14. VRCameraOffsetFix - this script allows you to quickly solve the problem with the incorrect VR camera offset in the game build (this problem was noticed on Oculus Quest 2 due to incorrect settings of the play zone).
15. XRGrabInteractableExtra - use this script instead of the original "XR Grab Interactable" component to control the "grab/drop" and "HoverEnter/HoverExit" processes.
